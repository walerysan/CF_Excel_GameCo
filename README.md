**An end-to-end data analysis with Excel for a video games online store.**<br>
_Analysis performed for learning purposes with CareerFoundry educational platform_

GameCo is a fictive video game seller present globally with its strongest markets in North America, Europe, and Japan. The goal of the analysis was to uncover insights from historical sales data to recommend changes in the marketing budget.

In this introduction to Data Analytics, I learned to conduct a complete end-to-end analysis of data set using an industry-standard tool Excel.

The data set contains 16,600 observations with sales numbers for each game’s title from 1980-2020, as well as the game’s genre, platform, publisher, and publishing year. 

VGChartz was the main source of data for this fabricated set.

To **explore** the new data set, I worked through initial steps to understand the data using filtering, grouping, and summarizing functions, pivot tables, and charts to uncover first insights about the best sellers in each of the markets, as well as the development of the sales throughout 40 years. Finding dirty data and using cleaning techniques helped me to prepare the set for further analysis. 
I also explored data limitations that may have been caused by the collection methods, and potential bias as a result of those limitations. The sales numbers represent only games that sold over 100.000 copies only, excluding the marginalized ones.  

In the introduction to **descriptive statistics**, I learned the concepts such as measures of central tendency, distribution, spread, quartiles, or outliers that led me through the basics of exploratory data analysis.

To read the results, I learned to prepare **visualizations** in form of histograms, box and whisker plots, and scatterplots. They are a great way to spot any unusual values and are easy to communicate to stakeholders during the process of data analysis.
By exploring sales data of the North American region, I found out that the low number of high sales values drives the average value up leaving the median lower and making the distribution of data right-skewed.
I found it very interesting to visualize the relationship between North American sales vs. Global sales, as I learned from exploration analysis that NA has the highest share in the globally sold games.

In the final presentation for the management board of GameCo, I showcased my findings and put them in the context of the goal of the analysis. The understanding of GameCo was, that sales for the various geographic regions have stayed the same over time. By conducting the analysis, I challenged their expectations and recommended changes in the marketing budget for the next year.

When working on this project, I learned to combine the most important components of descriptive analysis with functions and charts available in Excel. All this helped me to uncover and present valuable insights for GameCo.
